# Youtube-Data-Analysis
This project, YouTube Data Harvesting &amp; Analysis, is all about gathering, storing, and studying information from different YouTube channels. It uses the YouTube Data API to get the data, then stores it in MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. You can interact with and analyze this data through an easy-to-use interface made with Streamlit.
